            <p class="title">Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) for styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? </p>
            <article>
                <br>
                In my opinion, using relative size for styling the size of elements matter in our design. Em and rem are flexible, scalable units which are translated by the browser into pixel values, depending on the font size of your design. If a value of 1em or 1rem is used , the browser translates it to 16px - 160px or any other value. Using em and rem units gives us flexibility and the ability to scale elements up and down. The flexibility makes our design to become more responsive and to allow browser users to control the overall scale of sites for maximum readability. %, em, rem is useful because it is based on the default font which is not in fixed size.
                Defining font sizes in px is not accessible, because the user cannot change the font size in some browsers.
               Since users need to be able to zoom  without loss of content or functionality, the website should be responsive.

            <p class="title">We said 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px ?</p><br>
            <article>
               Pixels in CSS are angular measurements.They are not the direct measurements of the actual screen.The pixels in CSS shows the length of the area in which an element will be displayed while the pixels in the browsers shows the screen resolution.If the default browser's width by default is 16px(1em).If you want a font-size of 20px then 20px/16px=1.25em is used.10 em is now therefore 200px.The default will be changed to 20px.

            <p class="title">The specific changes in CSS3</p>
            <article>
                <br>
                1.<strong> Animations and Transitions</strong>-there are two ways to create CSS animations.The first is to use CSS properties with the ‘transition’ declaration.The second way involves the description of specific moments of the animation with the ‘code>@keyframe ’ rule.<br>
                2.<strong> Calculating values with calc()</strong>-the calc() function allows you to do simple arithmetic calculations in CSS.<br>
                3.<strong> Advanced selectors</strong>-you don't need to specify classes and IDs for every element. Instead, you can utilize the attribute field to style them.<br>
                4.<strong> CSS 3 Gradient</strong>-help to create smooth transitions between colors without having to resort to images. They can be linear or radial, and can be set to repeat. <br>
                5.<strong> Box Images</strong>- ‘border-image’ property allows you to display custom designed borders around elements.<br>
                6.<strong> Media Queries</strong>-  help to build sites that are responsive and which adapt to the type of device, orientation and resolution.<br>
                7.<strong> CSS Columns</strong>-column-based layouts are implemented by using the CSS ‘columns’ rule.<br>
                8.<strong>  CSS 3 RGBA</strong>- CSS 3 introduces a modification and added opacity manipulation to this property. RGB has been transformed to RGBA (Red Green Blue Alpha channels), which simplifies how you control the opacity of elements.<br>
                9.<strong> CSS 3 Web Fonts</strong> - CSS 3 also facilitates embedding any custom font on a webpage.<br>
                10.<strong> CSS 3 Text Shadow</strong>-The new text-shadow property allows you to add shadows to the text on a webpage. <br><br><br>
